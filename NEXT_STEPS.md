## 🚀 Your Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

You have two options:

#### Option A: Use the Helper Script (Easiest!)

Since you're on Windows with Git Bash, run:

```bash
./setup-github.sh
```

Or if using Windows Command Prompt:

```cmd
setup-github.bat
```

The script will:
- Ask for your GitHub username
- Ask for repository name (default: MCP-figma)
- Configure the remote
- Offer to push immediately

#### Option B: Manual Setup

1. **Create repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `MCP-figma` (or your choice)
   - Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Don't** initialize with README/license/gitignore
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect and push:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MCP-figma.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

After pushing to GitHub:

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MCP-figma`
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Click **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - Source: Select **GitHub Actions**
5. That's it! No need to save, it's automatic

### 3. Wait for Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You'll see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for it to complete
4. Once green ✅, your site is live!

### 4. Access Your Sites

Your sites will be available at:

- **Main index**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/MCP-figma/`
  - Lists all your generated sites
  
- **AI Workshop site**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/MCP-figma/ai-llm-workshop/`
  - Your first landing page!

## 📁 Repository Structure

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Magic of GitHub Actions

When you push to `main`:

1. **Trigger**: GitHub Actions detects the push
2. **Build**: 
   - Creates `_site/` directory
   - Copies all `site_*` folders
   - Generates beautiful index page listing all sites
3. **Deploy**: 
   - Publishes to GitHub Pages
   - Your sites go live automatically!

### Adding More Sites

When you generate a new landing page from Figma:

```bash
# Generate new site (via Copilot + Figma MCP)
# Creates: site_NEW_DESIGN/

# Commit and push
git add site_NEW_DESIGN/
git commit -m "Add new landing page: NEW_DESIGN"
git push

# That's it! GitHub Actions deploys automatically 🚀
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Image Assets

Your current site uses `localhost:3845` for images. Before going live:

1. **Download images** from Figma MCP server
2. **Create assets folder** in your site:
   ```bash
   mkdir site_ai-llm-workshop/assets
   ```
3. **Update image paths** in `index.html` from:
   ```html
   <img src="http://localhost:3845/assets/abc123.png">
   ```
   To:
   ```html
   <img src="./assets/abc123.png">
   ```

### First Deployment

- First deployment might take 2-3 minutes
- Subsequent deployments are faster (30-60 seconds)
- Check the Actions tab if something seems wrong

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when pushing?

You need to authenticate with GitHub:

```bash
# Configure Git with your GitHub credentials
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# You'll be prompted for username/password on first push
# Use a Personal Access Token as password (not your GitHub password)
# Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

### Workflow not running?

1. Check **Actions** tab → Enable workflows if needed
2. Verify `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists
3. Make sure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"

### Page shows 404?

1. Wait a few minutes after first deploy
2. Check Actions tab for deployment status
3. Verify the URL structure matches your repository name

2. **Set up Vercel** for better preview URLs (future step)
3. **Build the Figma plugin** for in-app review (future step)
4. **Add automation scripts** to streamline the workflow
